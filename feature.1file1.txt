this is a feature.1file1.txt

this was created in a new branch named feature-1

Firstly, I created a new repository on Github by clicking on the "New" button on my Github homepage.
I gave my repository a name "git-tuts", and made it public.

Next, I cloned the repository to my local system by copying the repository's URL from Github 
and using the "git clone" command in my terminal. 
This allowed me to have a local copy of my repository to work with.


Then, I opened my local code editor and created a new file "one.file.txt" in the main branch of my repository.
and added some content to it.


Once I had created my file, I used the "git add" command to stage my changes.
This means I told Git which changes I wanted to include in my next commit.
Then, I used the "git commit" command to commit my changes.
Finally, I used the "git push" command to push my changes to the main branch on Github. 
This made my changes visible in the remote repository on Github.


After that, I created a new branch "feature-1" in my repository using the "git checkout" command.
and in my new branch I described how i created a new branch in it and ...


After making my changes, I used the "git add" command to stage my changes.
Then, I used the "git commit" command. 
At last, I used the "git push" command to push my changes to my new branch on Github. 

This made my changes visible in the remote repository on Github, but only in the new branch I had created.
